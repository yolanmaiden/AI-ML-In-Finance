    "# Assignment 7 - Resume and Cover Letter Review\n",
    "I thought I'd do something fun for this assignment and use AI to create my resume and cover letter for a job posting at Wells Fargo since you both work there.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will try to use multiple AI agents, to highlight the technical experiences that are relevant to the job description I am applying for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Credits: This is taken from a course that I'm fortuitously taking after this class. The course is from deeplearning.ai and I will mostly follow the code they have provided. I really enjoyed this course too and I recommend you guys also look into it. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Job Posting:**\n",
    "Here's the job posting I'm applying to:\n",
    "https://www.wellsfargojobs.com/en/jobs/r-356243/senior-software-engineer/\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inputs:**\n",
    "The inputs into this process are my resume, a brief professional profile and a link to my github account highlighting my past work. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Output:**\n",
    "The output would be a resume and a cover letter that matches best to the job posting highlighting my relevant experience and expertise and hopefully increasing my chances of landing a job at Wells Fargo. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The workflow\n",
    "#### CrewAI Imports\n",
    "I will import crewAI tools that allow me to search the web, scrape a website and read local files. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Create Agents\n",
    "- Agent 1: Researcher\n",
    "This agent will have a job to search the internet using web scraping and internet search tools. The objective of this agent is to find qualifications and skills sought by employers, and form the foundation for effective application tailoring. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Agent 2: Profiler\n",
    "This agent will help build a profile that stands out in the job market. This agent will use web scraping, search internet, read local files, and search resume tools to achieve this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Agent 3: Resume Strategist\n",
    "This agent will use the same tools as the agent before it to create a resume that stands out in the job market. This is done by highlighting the most relevant skills and experiences, ensuring they resonate perfectly with the job's requirements. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Agent 4: Interview Preparer \n",
    "This agent will prepare a list of questions that could potentially be asked at an interview based on the job description. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Create Tasks for the Agents to perform\n",
    "The tasks are setup to do the following: \n",
    "1. Extract job requirements\n",
    "2. Compile Comprehensive Profile\n",
    "3. Align Resume with Job Requirements, with output file called \"tailored_resume.md\"\n",
    "4. Develop Interview Material, with output filed called \"interview_materials.md\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Create a \"Crew\"\n",
    "A crew is a collection of agents and tasks. The tasks and agents created above are grouped in a \"Crew\" that can be \"kicked off\" with different inputs in order to create desired results. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's run this and see what results we get."
